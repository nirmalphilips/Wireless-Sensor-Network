# **Design and Development of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**
---

## **Introduction**

This project presents the design and development of a wireless sensor network (WSN) capable of 
collecting, processing, and transmiƫng data for monitoring purposes. The project's goal was to create a reliable and effective WSN which is capable of monitoring environmental parameters Temperature, 
Distance and Position. The project consisted of geƫting familiar with the components, checking functionality in IDE, developing a webpage-based monitoring platform, and enabling wireless communication capabilities. The issues with sensor integration and wireless connection were resolved by repeated testing and debugging. The report gives an overview of the project's phases, focuses on the work completed, shows the results and evaluations, and concludes by addressing the importance of the WSN design in actual wireless sensor applications.

## **Background**

### **Wireless Sensor Network Overview**

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a form of network that consists of several sensor nodes that are interconnected. These sensor nodes have sensing, processing, and communicaƟon capabiliƟes that enable them to collect and transfer data from their surroundings. WSNs are used in variety of industries in the 
real world. 
The goal of this project is to create a wireless sensor node that can gather data from Accelerometer, 
Ultrasonic and temperature sensors and transfer the data to a webpage. The project involves becoming 
familiar with the elements, tesƟng their performance, developing a plaƞorm for monitoring like a website, 
and puƫng wireless communicaƟon to use to link the WSN to other devices.
